Types of Data Structures
1) Physical Data Structures
2) Logical Data Structures

Physical data structures
 these store the data
 these data structres defines or decides how the memory is organised or allocated
 - Arrays 
    (fixed size) (static size)
    can be created in stack or in heap
 - Linked List 
    is a dynamic data structure
    size can be increased and decreased
    can be created in heap

Logical Data Structures
  Logical ds are implemented using physical ds
  The discipline or different operations that can be performed
  are defined by these logical ds
    1) Stack  - linear ds
    2) Queue  - linear ds
    3) Tree   - non linear ds
    4) Graph  - non linear ds
    5) Hash table  - tabular ds
