/*

Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by 
an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by 
an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.

for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {}   O(n)

for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {}  O(n**2)
}

similarly 3 for loop      O(n**3)

for(int i=n; i>1; i=i/2) {}   O(log(n))
